    Which of the following you should do to follow the good enough computing 
    practises?

    *a. Record the steps of data processing
    b. Version control your whole project
    *c. Write a README file
    *d. Separate source code and compiled code into src and bin directories.
    e. Comment out lines in code to modify program behaviour
    *f. Find libraries to make them do part of your work.

    a § Correct. It helps others to reproduce your project.
    b § False. Version control is not designed for binary file tracking and raw data does not require version tracking as it should be immutable.
    c § Correct. It is good to keep other contributors in mind by providing set up instructions and project overview.
    d § Correct. 
    e § No. You should find other ways to control program because commenting causes errors.
    f § Correct. There are many good libaries that ease work. Remember to test them first.
